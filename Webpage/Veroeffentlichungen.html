      <h2> <strong> Implementation of an IoT and Cloud-Based Digital Twin for Real-Time Decision Support in Port
          Operations </strong></h2>
      <p>
        Seaborne trade volumes are growing and the resulting traffic load on the road infrastructure in port areas calls
        for new solutions to improve handling and coordination of vehicles and shipments. In this contribution, a
        digital twin for truck dispatching operator assistance is presented, which enables the determination of optimal
        dispatching policies using simulation-based performance forecasts. Proprietary simulation software with limited
        interfaces, the application deployment in demanding industrial environments, and the integration of real-time
        sensor information represent three major challenges when realizing digital twin applications for logistics
        systems. This implementation therefore uses an extensible open-source simulation package and it is coupled with
        an IoT-platform for easy integration of real-time information. The digital twin is deployed as a cloud-based
        service, allowing for simple deployment and scalability.</p>

      <h2> <strong>Assignment methods for dual-load vehicles in horizontal traffic of container terminals</strong>
      </h2>
      <p>
        The container terminal is the interface for a multitude of parties with different objectives. For the terminal
        operator the degree of capacity utilisation of their own handling equipment is of great importance. On the other
        side, shipping companies seek to reduce the vessels’ lay time at berth. The aim of this paper is to illustrate
        the impact of certain allocation methods for horizontal transportation vehicles over the period of the ships’
        total lay time and the capacity utilisation of the gantry cranes. Furthermore, especially the impact of the
        vehicles’ dual-load capacity is embraced. In addition, main aspects for the analysis refer to the influence of
        empty transportations and the impact of the insertion of transport orders, which are enabled by the dual-load
        capacity.</p>

      <h2><strong>Simulation and Virtual Commissioning of Modules for a Plug-and-Play Conveying System</strong></h2>
      <p> Changeable material flow systems as well
        as the use of material flow simulation represent approaches to cope with the challenges of future logistics
        operations in times of growing complexity, frequently varying demands and shorter product lifecycles. Modular
        plug-and-play continuous conveying systems are a special type of changeable material flow systems suitable to
        meet the imposed requirements. This paper presents how simulation methods can be applied to support the
        development of modules for this kind of system. As an example, a simulation model for the virtual commissioning
        of modules for an "Industry 4.0-Learning Factory" is described.</p>

      <h2><strong>Dispatching Strategies of Drayage Trucks at Seaport Container Terminals with Truck Appointment
          System</strong></h2>
      <p> Implementing a truck appointment system at container terminals is a successful method to
        smoothen peaks in truck arrivals and thereby reduce truck waiting times and congestion in the port area. This
        paper aims to analyze different strategies of time window selection for port drayage companies considering
        different company sizes and competitor’ strategies. The results show that an early booking of appointments at
        container terminals is beneficial for the success rate of trucking companies. Furthermore, it is highlighted
        that the truck turn time of small-sized companies in this network is higher than the one of large-sized
        companies.</p>

      <h2><strong>Integrating Virtual Commissioning Based on High Level Emulation into Logistics Education</strong></h2>
      <p>Increasing complexity is challenging logistics control systems development and
        commissioning. Emulation and virtual commissioning promise benefits over the classical approach, not only when
        used for lower level controls (e.g. PLC codes), but also for higher level controls such as material flow
        controls. This paper describes a general strategy to realize a virtual commissioning (based on VDI 3633),
        extended by the PDCA-approach known from quality management. A practical example shows how emulation and virtual
        commissioning can be integrated into and contribute to logistics education.</p>

      <h2><strong>A Simulation Tool to Assess the Integration of Cargo Bikes into an Urban Distribution System</strong>
      </h2>
      <p>The use of cargo
        bikes for goods deliveries represents a promising concept of urban logistics. In this contribution, a new
        simulation-based assessment tool integrating this emission free vehicles in urban distribution systems is
        presented. First, typical schemes are identified and an analysis of the underlying planning problems is
        conducted. Second, the developed GIS-based discrete-event simulation model and the coupled tour-planning
        algorithm are described, implementing the pattern of control optimization. To the best of our knowledge, such a
        tool is not yet existing. Finally, the tool is applied, evaluating the potential use of cargo bikes for
        B2B-deliveries in the medium size city of Grenoble in France.</p>
